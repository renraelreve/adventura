Welcome to Adventura

1) As a user, I want to see the dashboard showing a photo grid of the places of attraction in Singapore (can be random or based on those nearest to current locations, or based on highest ratings)

2) As a user, I can type in keywords to narrow down the options

3) As a user I can tap on the thumbnail to see the details of the locaton including information like …, ….., ….

4) As a user, I can see the location of the selected attraction on Singapoe map relative to my current location

5) As a user, I can save the details of the selected attraction into my “favourites”

6) As a user, I can write reviews and give star ratings to each location for others to see
